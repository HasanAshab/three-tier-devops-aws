# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements custom domain management for a three-tier application deployed on AWS. The system will configure SSL certificates and domain routing to provide secure, branded access to the frontend application via CloudFront and backend API via Application Load Balancer (ALB). The implementation includes automatic certificate provisioning through AWS Certificate Manager and proper DNS routing configuration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure custom domains for my three-tier application, so that users can access the application using branded domain names instead of AWS-generated URLs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the domain module is deployed THEN the system SHALL provision SSL certificates for three-tier-app.com, www.three-tier-app.com, and api.three-tier-app.com
2. WHEN a user visits three-tier-app.com or www.three-tier-app.com THEN the system SHALL serve the frontend application via CloudFront with HTTPS
3. WHEN a client makes API requests to api.three-tier-app.com THEN the system SHALL route traffic to the backend ALB with HTTPS
4. WHEN SSL certificates are provisioned THEN the system SHALL automatically validate certificates using DNS validation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the domain configuration to be modular, reusable and of my style, so that it can be easily integrated into existing infrastructure and maintained separately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the domain module is created THEN it SHALL be located in the /infra/modules directory structure
2. WHEN the module is implemented THEN it SHALL accept configurable inputs for domain names, certificate ARNs, and resource associations
3. WHEN the module is used THEN it SHALL output necessary values like certificate ARNs and domain validation records
4. WHEN the module is deployed THEN it SHALL integrate seamlessly with existing CloudFront and ALB resources

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want all domain traffic to use HTTPS with valid SSL certificates, so that data transmission is encrypted and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SSL certificates are created THEN the system SHALL use AWS Certificate Manager for certificate provisioning
2. WHEN certificates are validated THEN the system SHALL use DNS validation method for automatic verification
3. WHEN HTTP traffic is received THEN the system SHALL redirect to HTTPS automatically
4. WHEN certificates approach expiration THEN AWS Certificate Manager SHALL automatically renew them

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the domain configuration to support both apex and www domains for the frontend, so that users can access the application regardless of which variant they use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend certificate is created THEN it SHALL include both three-tier-app.com and www.three-tier-app.com as Subject Alternative Names
2. WHEN CloudFront is configured THEN it SHALL accept traffic for both domain variants
3. WHEN users access either domain variant THEN they SHALL receive the same frontend application
4. WHEN DNS records are created THEN both domain variants SHALL point to the CloudFront distribution

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an infrastructure maintainer, I want the domain module to provide clear outputs and validation records, so that DNS configuration can be completed and certificate validation can be verified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN certificates are created THEN the module SHALL output DNS validation records for each domain
2. WHEN the module is applied THEN it SHALL provide certificate ARNs as outputs for use by other resources
3. WHEN validation is required THEN the module SHALL clearly indicate which DNS records need to be created in Route 53
4. WHEN the module is deployed THEN it SHALL validate that all required inputs are provided and properly formatted
