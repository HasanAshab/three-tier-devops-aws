## 🚀 How to Apply

Follow these steps to deploy the infrastructure using Terraform:

### 1. Copy Environment Configuration

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

Edit `.env` and override necessary variables according to your environment (e.g., subscription ID, tenant ID, resource group names).

### 2. Load Environment Variables

```bash
source ./bin/load_env.sh
```

This script will export all environment variables defined in `.env` for the current shell session.

### 3. Select Terraform Workspace

Choose the workspace you want to deploy (e.g., `dev` or `prod`):

```bash
terraform workspace select dev
```

If the workspace doesn't exist yet, create it:

```bash
terraform workspace new dev
```

### 4. Apply Terraform Configuration

Run Terraform apply with the corresponding tfvars file:

```bash
terraform apply -var-file=./envs/dev.tfvars
```

For production:

```bash
terraform apply -var-file=./envs/prod.tfvars
```
